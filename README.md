High Content Screening (HCS) is closely related to image processing because it relies on the automated analysis of images obtained from fluorescence microscopy to extract quantitative information about cellular events. Image processing plays a crucial role in the HCS workflow, specifically during the image analysis step. The objective of image processing in HCS is to accurately identify, measure, and quantify various cellular parameters and features in a high-throughput and automated manner. This allows researchers to study the effects of different compounds or experimental conditions on cellular events at the single-cell level.

Several image processing techniques are employed in HCS, including:

Image segmentation: This process involves separating the regions of interest (e.g., individual cells, organelles, or cellular structures) from the background. Various algorithms can be used for segmentation, such as thresholding, watershed, or active contours.

Feature extraction: After segmentation, specific features or parameters of the identified regions are quantified. These features can include cell morphology, intensity, texture, or spatial distribution of fluorescent markers. The choice of features depends on the biological question being investigated.

Data analysis: The extracted features are analyzed to identify patterns, trends, or relationships between different cellular parameters. Statistical and machine learning techniques can be applied to classify or cluster the data, allowing researchers to draw conclusions about the effects of the tested compounds or conditions.

The main objective of using image processing in High Content Screening is to provide a robust, automated, and quantitative method for analyzing complex cellular events. This enables researchers to gain a deeper understanding of cellular biology, identify potential drug targets, and evaluate compound toxicity or efficacy in a high-throughput manner.
